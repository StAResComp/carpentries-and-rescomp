### About me

- Research Software Engineer
- Part of the Research Computing Service in IT Services
- Certified Carpentries Instructor
- Involved in organising Carpentries workshops at St Andrews
- Contact:
    - pgm5@st-andrews.ac.uk
    - research-computing@st-andrews.ac.uk
    - carpentries@st-andrews.ac.uk

notes:

A Research Software Engineer is someone who contributes to research primarily
through the development of software. They may be in part of research groups or
a central service.

I'll explain more about the Carpentries and the Research Computing Service in
this presentation, starting with the Carpentries.

## The Carpentries

### Vision

> Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding
> skills.

<small>Ref: https://carpentries.org/about/</small>

### Mission

- Builds capacity in data and computational skills for efficient, open,
  reproducible research
- Trains and fosters an active, inclusive and diverse community of learners and
  instructors
- Collaboratively develops openly-available lessons and delivers them using
  evidence-based teaching practices

notes:

The Carpentries builds global capacity in essential data and computational
skills for conducting efficient, open, and reproducible research. We train and
foster an active, inclusive, diverse community of learners and instructors that
promotes and models the importance of software and data in research. We
collaboratively develop openly-available lessons and deliver these lessons
using evidence-based teaching practices. We focus on people conducting and
supporting research.

### History

- Started as Software Carpentry in 1998
- Now also includes Data Carpentry and Library Carpentry
- There have been workshops on all 7 continents
- Over 2000 certified instructors listed online

notes:

Data Carpentry courses are discipline-specific e.g. Astronomy, Ecology,
Genomics, Geospatial data, Image processing, Social Sciences.
Library Carpentry focuses on building skills within library and
information-related communities.
Training as an Instructor involves a 2-day workshop and some follow-up
activity.

--

### Workshops

- Lessons typically delivered as 2-day workshops
- Learners work on their own computers where possible
- Live coding - instructors enter code in real time and learners follow along
- Ideally:
    - 20 learners
    - 2 instructors
    - 4 helpers

## The Carpentries at St Andrews

### Context

- A Research Data Management survey sent to all researchers in 2016 included a
  few questions on software.
  - 60% of respondents wrote code as part of their research
  - They were across all Schools
  - Fewer than 30% of those who wrote code used version control

notes:

Almost all respondents from CompSci reported using version control - the
proportions were much lower elsewhere.

--

### Getting started

- I had been in touch with Dr. Olexandr Konovalov from Computer Science, who
  was a certified Software Carpentry Instructor.
- We met with CAPOD with a view to organising workshops for researchers from
  across the University.
- We ran our first workshops with CAPOD in spring 2017.
- We've run at least 2 workshops a year with CAPOD/OSDS since.

--

### Our workshops

- 2-day workshop
- 1 day of Programming
  - Usually Python, sometimes R
- &frac12; day of the Unix Shell
- &frac12; day of Version Control with Git

notes:

Usually 2 consecutive full days.
Shell is generally the first morning, Git the second morning, Programming in
the afternoons.

--

### Building capacity

- To begin with, we needed to bring in instructors from outside to support
  Olexandr.
- In November 2017 I got certified as a Carpentries Instructor.
- We now have six certified instructors at the University, and run other
  workshops besides those done with OSDS.

--

### Challenges

- Half of our Instructors are PhD students, who don't necessarily expect to be
  at the University long-term.
- Others have teaching commitments that can make it hard to plan workshops in
  advance of timetables being confirmed.
- Recruiting helpers can be difficult.

---

## Getting involved

--

### Helpers

- Helpers are crucial to Carpentries workshops.
- They provide one-to one support to learners when they encounter issues e.g.
  - Problems installing software
  - Understanding a line of code
  - Interpreting an error message

--

- Helpers need some knowledge of the subjects being taught, but don't need to
  be experts.
- They do need to be:
  - Inclusive, respectful, mindful and welcoming
  - Willing to admit the limits of their knowledge
  - Willing to work with learners to guide and encourage them to solutions
  - Aware of their language, taking care not to demotivate or be dismissive

--

- Helpers may well learn something themselves.
- They get an opportunity to meet others engaged in computational research
- If you're interested, please contact carpentries@st-andrews.ac.uk

### Instructors

- Become a Carpentries Instructor to:
  - Improve the working environment
  - Build a reputation
  - Practice teaching
  - Expand/acquire technical and transferable skills
  - Join a vibrant community
  - Have fun

notes:

- To make your world better. By teaching their peers how to accomplish more
  with software and data skills, Carpentries Instructors are improving the
  environment that they themselves work in, clearing obstacles to their own
  success.
- To build a reputation. Teaching a workshop is a great way for people to
  introduce themselves to places they would eventually like to work, and a
  great way to make contact with potential collaborators around the world.
- To get practice teaching. Carpentries Instructors learn to implement
  evidence-based practices in a supportive, team environment. They also receive
  feedback through Carpentries surveys, creating a track record that can be
  useful in applications for teaching-related positions.
- To help get people of diverse backgrounds into the pipeline. Some of our
- Instructors are involved in part because they want computational science to
  include people from a broader range of backgrounds.
- To expand your technical skills. Carpentries Instructors continue to learn
  the very skills they teach, and more! Not only is teaching an excellent way
  to solidify existing skills, teaching with a team exposes you to new tips and
  tricks from others along the way.
- To acquire useful skills for all careers. Even “non-teaching” jobs demand
  skills that can be learned through teaching, especially as part of a team.
  You are welcome to borrow this wording to describe these skills in any
  professional context.
- To join a community of people who care about inclusive teaching of
  computational skills.
- Because it is fun. It really is!

--

- Becoming an Instructor involves attending a 2 day training event (in-person
  or online) and completing three short checkout tasks.
- If you're interested, please contact carpentries@st-andrews.ac.uk

notes:

Checkout process:
- Attend a 1-hour welcome session
- Complete a short teaching demonstration
- Get involved:
  - Be an instructor or helper at a workshop
  - Attend a regional call or other community session
  - Contribute to Carpentries materials

### Software solutions

- We work with researchers to provide the software they need for their
  projects.
- Across all disciplines.
- Solutions include:
  - Websites
  - Document/image repositories
  - Databases
  - Mobile applications

--

### Software solutions

- Priority is given to funded work
- Ideally:
  - We would be involved in writing the funding application
  - One of our Research Software Engineers would be named in the application

--

#### Examples

- A range of projects with MASTS (Marine Alliance for Science and Technology
  for Scotland) e.g. [SIFIDS](https://masts.ac.uk/research_projects/scottish-inshore-fisheries-integrated-data-system-sifids-project/)
- St Andrews Encyclopaedia of Theology: https://www.saet.ac.uk
- Analytical Database of Arabic Poetry: https://www.arabicpoetry.ac.uk
